  name: Narrow Crevasse
  description: |
    The stone walls here come narrowly close, within a foot or so of each other. The goblins have set up a small impassable barricade on one side, and keep watch, shooting at anyone that tries to enter with crossbows.

    If a creature tries to enter the tunnel, they are effectively restrained with a move speed of 10ft - or 5ft, if they fail a DC 13 DEX check. The crevasse is only 10ft long, however.

    It is impossible to move past another creature in the tunnel.
  creatures:
  - 1d4 goblins
  tactics: |
    The goblins here take turns keeping watch on the tunnel. At the first sign of trouble, they all rush to the barricade and shoot at whoever is closest.
