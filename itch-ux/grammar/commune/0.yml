  description: >
    Cages line the walls, host to any number of small woodland creatures that have been captured by the goblins. In the middle of the room is a large pit, surrounded by wooden reinforcement - animals and prisoners are thrown in here to fight each other to the death.
  creatures:
  - 1 goblin boss
  - 2d4 goblins
  - 1d2 black bears
  - 1d2 giant spiders
  - 1 giant hyena
  tactics: >
    Typically the goblins will scatter. If surprised, the boss will release the animals before fleeing, hoping the chaos will dissuade any attacker
