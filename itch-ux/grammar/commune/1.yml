  description: |
    In the middle of the room is a a large battleaxe atop a stone pillar. Each morning a prisoner is sacrified by a priest of Maglubiyet to stain the axe. Around the walls of the room are numerous cages, holding either small woodland animals or captured people (if the Goblins can manage that).

    Arranged at the base of the pillar are numerous small trinkets from various prisoners that have been sacrificed. Many of these are stained with small droplets of blood.
  creatures:
  - 1 goblin boss (the priest)
  - 2d4 goblins
  tactics: >
    The goblin boss will organize his followers around him, encouraging them to die for Maglubiyet.

    Goblins will group up to try to grapple intruders while the boss attempts to use the axe to slay them.
