  description: |
    The ceiling of this room is quite low - only about 3ft. above the ground. Medium or larger creatures find moving through the room to be difficult terrain.

    Complicating matters, the room dips down towards the middle and has collected a lot of stagnant water. Stepping into the putrid waters any wounded creatures should roll a DC 11 Constitution save or become infected with Sewer Plague.
